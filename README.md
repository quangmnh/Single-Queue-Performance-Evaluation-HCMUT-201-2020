# Single-Queue-Performance-Evaluation-HCMUT-201-2020
Single queue's performance evaluation (Round Robin). Assignment from Mr.Tran Van Hoai, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, term 201, 2020. 

# About
This is a Performance Evaluation assignment from term 201,2020, Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, handed out by Mr. Tran Van Hoai.

In this assignement, we have to run a simulation of one type of **Single Queue** using **Simpy** and **Colab Notebook** (or **Jupyter Notebook**, situated). With this simulator, we perform an evaluation by creating full factorial experiments (2<sup>k</sup>) and conclude how each factor affect the performance of the queue.

For this project, we choose **Round Robin Single Queue**, which is the fifth topic of the assignment.
